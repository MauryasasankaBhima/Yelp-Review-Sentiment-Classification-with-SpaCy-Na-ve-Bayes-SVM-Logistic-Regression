# Yelp-Review-Sentiment-Classification-with-SpaCy-Na-ve-Bayes-SVM-Logistic-Regression

This project aims to classify Yelp reviews into positive or negative sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models. We apply text preprocessing with **SpaCy**, convert text to vectors using **TF-IDF**, and build classifiers using **Naïve Bayes**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Logistic Regression**.

##  Objective
To analyze textual Yelp reviews and automatically predict the sentiment (positive or negative) — helping businesses understand customer feedback at scale.

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
- scikit-learn (for TF-IDF, classifiers, metrics)
- pandas & NumPy (for data handling)

## Models Used
- **Naïve Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**

Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results Summary_
- Logistic Regression: ~89% accuracy
- SVM: ~88% accuracy
- Naïve Bayes: ~84% accuracy

##  Key Features
- Cleaned and processed Yelp review text using SpaCy
- Used TF-IDF for vectorizing text
- Compared multiple ML models
- Explained and visualized model performance
